# Audio Files

Place the following audio files in this directory:

## Sound Effects

- `click.mp3` - Sound effect for button clicks (short, satisfying click sound)
- `collect.wav` - Sound effect for collecting Krakenlings (gentle collection sound)

## Minigame Sound Effects

- `hope.wav` - Short sparkle/resolution cue for Hope (use when the path is completed)
- `courage.wav` - Firm but gentle hit for Courage (fires the moment the hold finishes)
- `connection.wav` - Warm chime for Connection (plays when the correct word is formed)
- `healing.wav` - Soft breath/pulse for Healing (triggers after keeping rhythm)

## Music

- `music.mp3` - Background music for the entire experience (calming, ambient loop)

## Notes

- All audio files should be in MP3 format
- Sound effects should be short (0.5-2 seconds)
- Minigame sounds are effects, not loops (no background beds needed)
- Background music should loop seamlessly
- Keep file sizes reasonable for web performance
